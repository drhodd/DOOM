Description             : This is a deathmatch area. There's a castle with 4
                          corner towers. There's a moat around the castle.
                          Inside on the bottom floor there is a maze at the
                          center of which is the map's only megasphere. But,
                          you have to press the button in one of the 4 corner
                          towers to lower it. So... good luck with that. 

                          The outside is open but with few items. The main
                          weapons are in the towers. The maze and the inside
                          ledges are filled with goodies.

                          All weapons are present except the BFG.
                          
                          As stated elsewhere this map requires GZDoom and
                          while it might run on other engines it will not play
                          correctly without the bridges, ramps or the ability
                          to jump.
