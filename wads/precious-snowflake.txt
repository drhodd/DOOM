Description             : This is a smooth, fast, rampy, multi-level DM pit
                          for 2 to 4. It makes heavy use of slopes and 3D
                          floors.
                          
                          No BFG, no chainsaw. All other weapons are
                          included. 

                          As stated elsewhere this map requires ZDoom or
                          GZDoom and while this map might run on other
                          engines it will NOT WORK without the bridges, ramps
                          or the ability to jump.
